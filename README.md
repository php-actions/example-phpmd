# An example project that uses [php-actions/phpmd][action-link]

This is a trivial project that holds only simple example functionality: a greeter that can greet you by name.

Check out the [**Actions tab** in the Github repository][actions-tab] to see the past actions workflows and their outputs.

The file at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` shows how to use [php-actions/phpmd][action-link] - take note of the `uses: php-actions/phpmd@v1` line.

Versions of PHPMD and all options are available to configure. Please see the [php-actions/phpmd documentation][action-link] for more information!
